# Old-Milburnie-Farm

## This is the development portion of the app.

https://oldmilburnie.herokuapp.com/

This web app was created for an organic farm.  http://www.oldmilburniefarm.com/.  The owner had no system in place to track his employees work time, the tasks that needed to be accomplished, the orders that were coming form local restaurants, and the harvests that were being completed. 

We created this app using Bootstrap 3, JQuery, and MySql.  There are also a few other little packages added the the full build such as jsPDF and html2canvas.  The deploye verision of this app is live and the client is using it.  This version is for test purposes only.
